jobapp
======
There are two pages:
index.php
and 
admin.php

If you wish to setup the code on a local environment set the source folder to /jobapp/src/v1.0/

from there you may access the pages based on the local url you assign the project.
index.php will load on http://localurl.dev (or whatever replacement for the tld you use, i like dev so i know its a development site)
then admin.php will load on http://localurl.dev/admin

the credentials for the admin panel are as such: 
username: admin
password: hirejoerice (just thought i'd throw a jedi mind trick in there)

everything should be commented well, if not please email me for any clarification.

use sql-dump.sql to populate your mysql database with the proper database and tables all formated correctly.
There is one admin in the system currently and no clients so you will need to sign up to populate the clients table 
so that you cna delete them in the admin panel.

sorry that this is getting in now, I finished this version a week or so ago and I've been working on a version 2 to send 
in, because as i was doing this version i kept thinking up good ideas i wanted to implement, so I have been working on those features
but they are proving a little more difficult to implement than i thouhgt. Either way i'm including the code that i have for version 2 
anyways so you can see what I've been up to with that version. 

hope you like what you see. and I hope to hear from you soon.
Thanks,

Joe Rice
